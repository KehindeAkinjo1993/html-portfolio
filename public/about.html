  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <img src="../assets/images/Me.jpeg" srcset="../assets/images/Me.jpeg 2500w"/>

  <p>I have a degree in Criminology and a Masters in Criminology With Forensic Psychology.
    I previously worked as a Probation Officer for some years but now work for Merton Council as 
    an Housing Options Advisor. However, I would like to progress as a Web Developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>I taught myself how to code during the pandemic in order to find progression in life
    and to build a successful career and make my parents proud.
